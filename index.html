                <p>It's not fair for anyone to expect a sophomore in college to have a fully formed resume. Few of us have even had internships. There are a couple things you can do though, to make yourself stand apart from your peers. First and foremost is to show off the hard work you've been doing the last year and a half! Our founder is a recruiter for top companies in the finance and tech space, and one of the first things he looks for on any resume is a portfolio website! There's just no better way to display your work. We understand, though, that it's beyond difficult to find the time to build a portfolio site between classes and an active coop search. That's where we come in. </p>
